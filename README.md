# Full Stack App

## Objectives
- Create first full stack application, connecting Ruby backend and Javascript frontend
- Use Heroku to host the application
- Create wireframes and user stories (userstories.txt file)
- Create two git repos, commit project at various times to respective repos
- Frontend includes index.html, fullstackapp.js, and main.css files

## Instructions

1. Login to user account, or create a new account if a first time user
2. Upload images to your gallery within your account

## Overview

I was tasked with creating a functional full stack application, allowing a user to log in (with authentication). Once logged in, a user can upload images to their account and view all existing images.

## Step 1: Create User Stories

See userstories.txt
Wireframes (see wireframe file with images)

## Step 2: Create two github repos, one with my backend project folder and one with my frontend project folder. Backend project folder includes all Ruby - models, controllers, table, routes, seeded data. Frontend folder includes Javascript and jQuery to connect to the backend, and styling - html, js, and css files.

## Step 3: Connect frontend to backend code, once backend has been created and tested

- Start in html file --> link jQuery source, stylesheet file, javascript file, bootstrap stylesheet

- Create divs for creating new users, logging current users in, uploading new images, and a hidden authentication div

- Use jQuery in project js file to create GET and POST requests for creating new accounts, logging users in, uploading user images, logging users out --> use hide and show functions depending on where a user is clicking/if they are logged in or not

## Step 4: Style page

- Style my page, use show/hide to show or hide different aspects of the page depending on user status

## Step 5: Deploy application to be hosted on Heroku
